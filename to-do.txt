TO DO:
at the start, fix height based on Q with maximum no. of options?


maybe add a local version of jquery3.3.1 to speed things up
(also means I can develop without internet)


MOBILE OPTIMISATIONS
- Result/Outcome text is two wide
- every page turn, user should return to top of screen
- two answer buttons per row on mobile would be good
- forward and backward buttons look odd - probably better to use an SVG design
